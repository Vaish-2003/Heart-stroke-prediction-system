Stroke is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced due to a blockage (ischemic stroke) or rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Without blood, the brain will not get oxygen and nutrients, so cells in some areas of the brain will die. This condition causes parts of the body controlled by the damaged area of the brain to not function properly.

Stroke is an emergency condition that needs to be treated as soon as possible, because brain cells can die in just a matter of minutes. Prompt and appropriate treatment measures can minimize the level of brain damage and prevent possible complications.

In this machine learning project, the overall topic that will be resolved is in the health sector regarding stroke, where it will try to predict the possibility of a stroke in a person with certain conditions based on several factors including: age, certain diseases (hypertension, heart disease) who are at high risk of developing stroke. strokes, cigarettes, etc.

As previously explained, stroke can kill the sufferer in a matter of minutes. Detecting stroke with the existing causative factors with the help of machine learning can be very useful in the world of health to detect stroke early in order to increase the sense of heart among sufferers so that strokes can be prevented early.
